# TicTacFind-It
TicTacFind-It is the classic TicTacToe infused with a twist! To be able to place your character (either 'X' or 'O') in place, you shall have to click a picture of an object/colour spoken into the device's microphone by your opponent! If correctly captured, your character will be placed in the selected box. Else, you skip a turn!

The app is developed on Thunkable, and uses Microsoft Azure's Computer Vision API for Object Recognition.
